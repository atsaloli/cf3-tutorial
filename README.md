# cf3-tutorial

This tutorial is built using the [Softcover](http://softcover.io/) book generation toolchain.

The source is in source/ and consists of many little numbered files that are used in the in-class "vim slideshow" (delivered by run_slides.sh)

source/build_softcover.sh builds the Softcover Markdown files (in chapters/) from the files in source/

So the overall flow is:

source/  ->  chapters/   ->  html/
