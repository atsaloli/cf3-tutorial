Add dot to PDF conversion workflow to build_softcover.sh

I have three dot files in the source/ directory:

	modified:   100-150-Policy_Flows-0070-Policy_Flow_Diagram.dot
	modified:   100-150-Policy_Flows-0080-Policy_Flow_Diagram_Clients.dot

and three in the images/figures/directory.

Need to work out how to convert them from DOT to PDF, and to add that to the script.

This was a manual workflow earlier.
