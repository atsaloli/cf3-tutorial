### List contents

Run the "l.sh" script to list the collection contents.

```bash
./l.sh
```

Notice the content is structured and the materials proceed
in sequence from most basic to more advanced.

If you need to find something, you can grep for it, or use
"l.sh" as a sort of "table of contents".
