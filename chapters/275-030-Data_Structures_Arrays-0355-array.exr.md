#### Make an array

Make an array (key/value collection) with two elements

Print the value of one element from this array (using the key)


#### Print array contents using getindices()

Print contents of the array from your last exercise
by using the getindices() function to get a list of
keys, and then iterate over the keys to extract the
values.

(Aleksey todo:
add definition of "index" and "indices"
)
