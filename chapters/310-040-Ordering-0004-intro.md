To facilitate convergence, CFEngine evaluates and repairs promises according to CFEngine "normal ordering" (see https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/master/guide-language-concepts-normal-ordering.html)

Promises of the same type are evaluated in the order they appear in the file.

Promises of different types are evaluated according to "normal ordering".
