Practice using "methods" type promises

* Write a policy that has two bundles.

  * The first bundle does something visible (such as a reports type promise that says "bundle1") AND calls the second bundle.

  * The second bundle reports "bundle2".

What output will you see and in what order?  Why?  Now run your policy and check.
