## Log repairs

With CFEngine Enterprise, we see all repairs through the Mission Portal.

With the Community Edition, it is helpful to log when a promise is repaired, so we can see what changes CFEngine is making where.

Write a promise that logs when it is repaired to '/var/log/cfengine/repairs.log'
