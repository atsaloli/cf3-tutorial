# Acknowledgements

This work is based on the materials of Mark Burgess and Northern.tech.

Thank you, Mark, for encouraging me to write and to teach. I grow personally and professionally from every interaction with you.

My thanks to my fellow CFEngineers, I've learned a lot from you: Neil Watson, Diego Zamboni, Ted Zlatanov, Nick Anderson, Brian Bennett, Martin Simons, Danny Sauer, Marco Marongiu, Bas van der Vlies, Dan Klein, Mike Weilgart, the good folks at Northern.tech, the intrepid souls at Normation, and the denizens of [help-cfengine](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/help-cfengine).

Many of my professional course students have contributed bug reports and suggestions and I gratefully acknowledge their help in improving these materials.

Special thanks to Dan Barber for organizing my course materials into protobook form.
