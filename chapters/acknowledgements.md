# Acknowledgements

This work is based on the materials of Mark Burgess and CFEngine AS.

Thank you, Mark, for encouraging me to write and then to teach. I grow personally and professionally from every interaction with you.

Thank my fellow CFEngineers, I've learned a lot from you: Neil Watson, Diego Zamboni, Ted Zlatanov, Nick Anderson, Brian Bennett, Martin Simons, Danny Sauer, Marco Marongiu, Bas van der Vlies, Dan Klein, the good folks at CFEngine AS, the intrepid souls at Normation, and the denizens of the [help-cfengine](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/help-cfengine) mailing list.

Many of my professional course students have contributed bug reports and suggestions and I gratefully acknowledge their help in improving the course materials this tutorial grew from.

Special thanks to Dan Barber for helping to organize the course materials into early proto-book form.
