commands:

  "/bin/echo `/bin/date`"

        comment => "By default, commands are run directly, not in a shell.
                    Shell features such as backticks, input/output redirection,
                    pipelining, file globbing, etc. are not available.
                    
                    You can tell CFEngine to run your command in a shell,
                    and we'll cover that later in the course.";
