### About the Author

I've been working in IT Operations since the mid-nineties, mostly as a
UNIX/Linux System Administrator of one kind or another, though now I'm
called DevOps Engineer.

I've helped a number of organizations, large and small, adopt CFEngine,
and have been recognized as a CFEngine Community Champion by Northern.tech,
the company behind CFEngine.

I was trained on CFEngine by Mark Burgess, the author of CFEngine.
