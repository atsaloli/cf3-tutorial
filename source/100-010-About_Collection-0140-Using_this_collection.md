### Using this collection

Our course "Automating System Administration using CFEngine 3" is
based on demonstration of "CFEngine Essentials" examples, along with
with discussion, lab exercises, and a policy-writing workshop.

To support the growing CFEngine 3 community, we are making available
our course materials online.

The materials are arranged in sequence, so your initial study
should be in sequence.

You can also use these materials as reference (feel free to pull
out examples and use them to seed your policy set).
