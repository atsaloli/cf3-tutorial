### About the Author

I've been working in IT Operations since the mid-nineties, mostly as a
UNIX/Linux System Administrator of one kind or another, though now they
call me DevOps Engineer.

I've helped a number of organizations adopt CFEngine, and have been
recognized as CFEngine Community Champion by Northern.tech, the company
behind CFEngine.

I was trained on CFEngine by Mark Burgess, the author of CFEngine.
