## Why CFEngine?

- Maturity (since 1993, now in its third generation)
- Small footprint (can run everywhere and run often)
- Fast!!
- Scalable (real-world deployments of hundreds of thousands of hosts
  or more)
- Security (check the US National Vulnerabilities Database, much less
  vulnerabilities due to a more secure design)
- Portable (many systems and platforms supported)
- The only configuration management tool based on science (author is a
  theoretical physicist turned Computer Science researcher)
