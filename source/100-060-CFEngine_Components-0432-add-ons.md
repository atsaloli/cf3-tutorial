### Add-ons

There are a number of add-on tools, they have to be installed separately:

**cf-diag**
: Diagnostic tool (checks the health of a CFEngine host).

**masterfiles-stage**
: Policy deployment tool - designed to run on the Policy Server and safely deploy policy from upstream locations to a directory on the Policy Server for distribution to clients.

**reindent.pl**
: Source code reformatter (like "tidy").

**cf-profile**
: Profiler (measures how long your bundles take to run so you can find and fix any slow spots).

**cf-remote**
: Tooling to deploy CFEngine.
