### CFEngine Packages

**cfengine-community**
: Open-source product, also known as CFEngine Core.

**cfengine-nova**
: Core plus Enterprise extensions (reporting, native Windows build, etc.).

**cfengine-nova-hub**
: This is cfengine-nova plus the Mission Portal (report collector, database, and a Web UI on an Apache/PHP/PostgreSQL stack).

Note: The name for the first generation of the CFEngine Enterprise product was "Nova", which is still reflected in the name of the packages. The original plan was to have progressively larger star names like "Constellation" and "Galaxy", each would have more features than the previous.
