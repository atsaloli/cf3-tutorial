### CFEngine Packages

**cfengine-community**
: Open-source product, also known as CFEngine Core.

The name for the first generation of the CFEngine Enterprise product was "Nova" and this is still reflected in the name of the packages:

**cfengine-nova**
: Core plus Enterprise extensions (Reporting, native Windows build, etc.)

**cfengine-nova-hub**
: Core plus Enterpise extensions plus Mission Portal (which is Report Collection system and an Admin GUI on an Apache/PHP/PostgreSQL stack with a Redis cache for report collection)

Packages for systems not supported by cfengine.com (e.g. MacOS, FreeBSD, Android, etc.) can be obtained from [www.cfengineers.net](http://www.cfengineers.net) (e.g. HP-UX)
