### Add-ons

There are a number of add-on tools, they have to be installed separately:

**cf-diag**
: Diagnostic tool (checks the health of a CFEngine host).

**masterfiles-stage**
: Policy deployment tool - designed to run on the Policy Server and safely deploy policy from upstream locations to a directory on the Policy Server for distribution to clients.

**cf-profile**
: Measures how long your code takes to run so you can make it blazing fast.

**cf-remote**
: Tooling to deploy CFEngine on remote hosts.
