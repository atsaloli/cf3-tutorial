### CFEngine Packages

CFEngine is available in two flavors.

#### Open Source Core

**cfengine-community**
: Open-source product, also known as CFEngine Core.

#### Enterprise

**cfengine-nova**
: Core plus Enterprise extensions (reporting, native Windows build, etc.).

**cfengine-nova-hub**
: cfengine-nova plus the the Mission Portal (Web UI on an Apache/PHP/PostgreSQL stack; and inventory and compliance report collector).

A note on naming: The name for the first generation of the CFEngine Enterprise product was "Nova", which is still reflected in the name of the Enterprise packages. The original plan was to have progressively larger star names like "Constellation" and "Galaxy", that would each have progressively more features.
