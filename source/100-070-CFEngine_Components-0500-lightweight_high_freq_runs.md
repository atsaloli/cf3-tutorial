Because CFEngine is lightweight, it's fast. It can be run frequently to monitor and maintain
infrastructure health.

CFEngine 1 was intended to be run once a day.

CFEngine 2 was intended to be run once an hour.

CFEngine 3 default run frequency is every 5 minutes.

At 5 minutes, systems can self-heal faster than if they were repaired by human operators.
