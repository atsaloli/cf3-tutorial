To do the exercises, each student should have two VMs:

One to play the role of the Hub, and one to play the role of a Host
connected to that Hub.

CFEngine itself is multiplatform. The examples in this collection
have been tested on RHEL 6.  If you're not sure what OS to install
on your VMs, we recommend you install the same OS as you use in
production and let us know if you have any trouble.
