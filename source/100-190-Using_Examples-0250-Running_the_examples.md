### Running the Examples: Inform Mode

By default, CFEngine doesn't inform you of changes it makes as reports
at scale (e.g. tens of thousands of systems) can be overwhelming.

However, while learning, it's educational to know when CFEngine makes
changes and what those changes are.

You can turn on Inform mode with `cf-agent -I` so that CFEngine informs
you of any changes it makes to your system.
