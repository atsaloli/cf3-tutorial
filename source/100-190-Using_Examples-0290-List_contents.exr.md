List collection contents using "l.sh"

I've created a shell script to list the collection
contents. It indents the part and chapter headings
to provide a sort of Table of Contents.

Try running it:

```bash
./l.sh
```

Notice the content is structured (the files are numbered).
The materials proceed in sequence from basic to advanced.

If the `l.sh` script does not work on your system
(or you don't like it), you can just run:

```bash
ls *.cf
```
