### Lab Infrastructure

#### Two VMs

To do the exercises, each student should have two VMs:

- one to play the role of the Hub (policy distribution point),
- another to play the role of a managed Host.

Normally, you would have multiple hosts managed from a single hub.
Two VMs gives us a CFEngine-managed system in miniature.
