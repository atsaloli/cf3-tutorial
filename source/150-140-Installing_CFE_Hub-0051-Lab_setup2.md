#### Vagrant

CFEngine provides a turnkey solution with Vagrant.

You can follow [CFEngine's Vagrant
guide](https://docs.cfengine.com/latest/guide-installation-and-configuration-general-installation-installation-enterprise-vagrant.html)
to create your lab environment complete with two VMs and the latest
version of CFEngine Enterprise.

Otherwise the following details the lab requirements (if you want to put
together your own lab instead of using the CFEngine Vagrant lab).
