### Promise

**Promise**
: A promise is a statement of intention.

Trust is an economic time-saver. If you can't trust you have to verify,
and that is expensive.

To improve trust we make promises. A promise is the documentation of
an intention to act or behave in some manner. This is what we need to
learn to trust systems.
