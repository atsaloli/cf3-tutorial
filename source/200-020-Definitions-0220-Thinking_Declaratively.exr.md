Learning to Think Declaratively

1. State an actual sysadmin problem you need to solve

2. Envision the desired end state; state what the desired end result is, in a declarative (not procedural) fashion.

In other words, focus on the WHAT and let CFEngine handle the HOW (which may vary from OS to OS anyway).
