#### Everything is a promise

CFEngine works on a simple notion of promises. Everything in CFEngine
can be thought of as a promise to be kept by different resources in
the system.

CFEngine manages every intended system outcome as "promises" to be kept.

Promises are always things that can be kept and repaired continuously,
on a real time basis, not just once at install-time.
