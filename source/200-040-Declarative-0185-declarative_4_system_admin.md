### Declarative Programming for System Administration
> Declarative programming is a more natural fit for managing system
> configuration. We want to be talking about whether or not MySQL is
> installed on this machine or Apache on that machine, not whether yum
> install mysql-server has been run here or apt-get install apache2
> there. It allows us to express intent more clearly in the code. It is
> also less tedious to write and can even be more portable to different
> platforms.
