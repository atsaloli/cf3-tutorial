Kill a process

Start print services manually (e.g., `yum install -y cups; service cups
start`) and then write and run a promise to signal the `cupsd` process
TERM and KILL

Don't copy and paste, type it yourself.

Try to do it from memory.

Hint: TERM and KILL are the signal names; but signal name values in CFEngine
are in lower-case and CFEngine is case-sensitive.
