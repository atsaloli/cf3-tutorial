### Handling of the output from reports promises

Where does the output from reports promises go?

When you run `cf-agent` on the command line, any reports or output
generated by your promises go to STDOUT.

When the executor daemon `cf-execd` runs `cf-agent`, a copy of all output
from `cf-agent` is saved to "/var/cfengine/outputs/" with a timestamp in
the filename. Additionally, a symlink "previous" is updated to point at
the most recent outputs file.

`cf-execd` may additionally forward output to syslog and/or email it.
This is all configurable.
