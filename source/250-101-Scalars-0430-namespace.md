### Namespaces

To take this concept a step further, bundle and body names can be placed
in a namespace, allowing multiple files to define the bundles and bodies
with the same name in different namespaces without conflict. They are
key to writing self-contained, reusable, sharable policies.

Everything in CFEngine lives in a namespace (it's the `default` namespace
if not set).
