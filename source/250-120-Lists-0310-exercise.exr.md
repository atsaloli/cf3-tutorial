Create a list variable containing names of five files to create.

For example:

      /tmp/file1
      /tmp/file2
      /tmp/file3
      /tmp/file4
      /tmp/file5

Then use a single "files" promise to ensure all five files exist.

This is an example of Patterns + Promises = Configuration.

The list is a pattern (which parts of the infrastructure are affected).

The promise is to create a file.
