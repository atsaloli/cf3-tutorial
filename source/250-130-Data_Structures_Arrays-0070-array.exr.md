Print array contents using getindices()

Create an array with two things and their values.

e.g.

| Car | Cost |
|-----|------|
| BMW | 120K |
| Audi| 150K |

Report the contents of this array by using the `getindices()` function to
get a list of keys, and then iterate over the keys to output the values.
