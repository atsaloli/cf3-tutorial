## Promise Handles

A promise handle is a short name for a promise -- it's the unique id of a promise.

Handles are essential for mapping dependencies and performing impact analyses.

Promise handles have to follow the rule for CFEngine identifiers:
characters allowed are alphanumerics and underscores only (no spaces).
