### Introducing templates

What are templates?  Why would we use templates?

(In class, a brief introductory talk is given for sysadmins that haven't
worked with templates.)

underscore) to set out our tokens from the rest of the text. This will
make it easy to find and replace the tokens with their values (to fill
in the template with values) without accidentally replacing actual text.
