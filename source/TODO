Add definitions of Index and Indices to the Arrays section

make sure we have an exercise to bootstrap the hub:

root@ubuntu:~# /var/cfengine/bin/cf-agent --bootstrap  192.168.23.151 
R: This host assumes the role of policy server
R: Updated local policy from policy server
R: Started the server
R: Started the scheduler
  notice: Bootstrap to '192.168.23.151' completed successfully!

-------------------------------------------------------------

Add a chapter on attribute types

- add Agent Promise Attributes (appendix C from "Learning CFEngine 3") to this book
- add a GLOSSARY with ALL terms defined
- look at templates/
- look at 1.cf.  It shows three ways that a list can be
  used.  It should be broken up into three slides.
- is there a way to extract the second element of a list?
- give a simple example of using an array
- add my reference materials to Reference chapter
- Break up "CFEngine Special Variables" chapter 
- Break up "Copying Files" chapter into Local/Remote
- Add a chapter on the Reference manual, and an orientation to the CFEngine BoK, books, etc.
Make sure we have a link to www.verticalsysadmin.com/cfengine/
- Add a "further study" section

8-Oct-2015

- add perl script that reformats the cfengine policies to version control
  of VSA_Training_Examples
  and publish it to the class...   

TO DO:

course materials:
- portrait orientation
- revision date
- separate repo for mkpdf toolchain

-----------------------------------------------------------

if you put a sequence of signals like

  signals => { "term", "kill" }

how long does CFEngine wait after sending TERM before
sending KILL?

-----------------------------------------------------------

give an example of shutting down cups and disabling it in a more portable way

chkconfig is a red hat thing

add to cfengine_stdlib.cf standard_services bundle  "disable" handling

where does CFEngine get its lifecycle information?  (3 year lifecycle)


bundle agent example {

classes: 

  "one-two"

       expression => "any";

reports:

  one_two::

         "Yay!";


                     }

chapter 100 is out of order, shold be after body-parts

----------------------

how about making promise attributes comma delimited, in body parts?  that
would be harmonious to how they are detailed in the promise body

---------------------------

add an index to the reference manual (cfengine reserved word index)

---------------------------

500 data types should be before Body Parts (because body parts examples
contain lists)

0-----

reference value mentions "first, last, all" in comments in examples
as possible values for "occurrences" but now it is only "first, all"

----
add more exericses to the course	

-----------

parser:

students type "body agent" instead of "bundle agent" sometimes

(but we do want to be able to say "body agent control")


--------

according to 3.3.8 cf-promises, this is a valid promise:

bundle agent myname {

files:

}

----

in 3.3.8, this creates a directory but does not tell us

it should say:
  -> Created directory /tmp/etc

Press ENTER or type command to continue
 >> Using command line specified bundlesequence
 -> Created file /tmp/etc/motd, mode = 600
R: All systems nominal


------------------

how do you cancel a persistent class?

(add a demo)

------------------

put the COPBL section in logical order.  remove the file select example to an
Appendix section

------------------------
Ask neil watson if he could make the vim syntax highlighter 
warn us if we use anything other than a cfengine reserved 
word on the LHS.
--------------------------

Array of lists example does not work

------------------------------

top of page 29

action => if_repaired

should be

classes => if_repaired

------------------------------

discuss default bundlesequence (run all the bundles in the input file in the
order they appear) on the help-cfengine mailing list


---


it would be nice if methods type promises, the promiser defaulted to
"any"

---

question from Shing and Ammon, cleanup of /var/cfengine/outputs results
in a non-zero Promises Repaired percentage.  How to separate the promises
related to cfengine's internal maintenance from system repair promises?

---

to do

- publish CFEngine Design Center half-day class

- make a functions summary reference card

- add example screenshot of Topic Maps

- send poster
